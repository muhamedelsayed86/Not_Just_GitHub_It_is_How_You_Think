## Why organizations should use GitHub for Development process ?

**The #1 Developer Community on the Planet**

## Software Industry

Saying *“software industry”* is a very big term — much bigger than just writing code or testing a program you’ve made

### Why visibility is so important ?

If you’re working with a team and you don’t show your work, then to them, you’re basically a passive (inactive) member



#### If your team can't see what you are doing ?

* The first impression about you will be that you’re not working
* Worse than that, people might think you’re working the wrong way
* This will affect the whole team’s performance, not just yours
* You’ll find yourself falling behind because the problems you face won’t show up early
* You’ll become kind of disconnected from the team, and no one will know where you are or how far you’ve gotten
* You might be doing great work, but if no one sees it, it’s as if you’ve done nothing at all
* You’ll end up defending yourself a lot instead of letting your work speak for you
* This will hurt your image with leadership, and you’ll appear as someone who can’t be relied on
* And that means no one will be able to evaluate your skills properly

**Still determined to work in the shadows ?**



## Lean Software Development (LSD)

This is a software development approach whose main goal is to work **smart**, not just harder. It means reducing anything unnecessary and delivering what the customer wants in the fastest and simplest way.

* **Eliminate Waste**
  Don’t work on features no one will use, don’t write code that won’t be executed, and don’t waste months waiting for approvals. Focus only on what really matters.

* **Empower the Team**
  When the team has decision-making freedom and takes responsibility for its work, the quality improves. No micromanagement—people work comfortably, and that shows in the results.

* **Deliver Fast**
  You don’t have to wait until the whole project is finished to show it. Deliver small parts quickly, keep testing, and get customer feedback early.

* **Optimize the Whole**
  Don’t try to improve one part of the process if it harms the rest. Keep the whole team aligned around the same goal and make sure the entire workflow runs smoothly.

* **Build Quality In**
  Quality isn’t something you add at the end. From writing code, to testing, to reviewing—you should always keep quality in mind.

* **Defer Decisions**
  Wait until you fully understand things before making big decisions. This doesn’t mean being lazy, but choosing the right timing leads to more mature and less risky decisions.

* **Amplify Learning**
  Learn from your mistakes and from user feedback. Practice is more important than theory, and every experience makes you better for what’s coming next.

## Backlog

The **Backlog** is simply a **list of all ideas or tasks that haven’t been done yet**. It can include features you want to add, bugs that need fixing, or tasks that are still in the thinking stage.

It’s like a **To-Do List**, but more organized, and it’s part of managing your project directly inside GitHub.


<img width="1920" height="847" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-15 145618" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d91b2473-e492-4677-a5b9-932560cd4842" />

**Where do we find it on GitHub ?**

* Go to your repository on GitHub.
* Click on **Create New**, then choose **“New Project.”**
* When creating the project, select **“Board.”** You’ll see several options—choose **Kanban**.



**Why should you use it in the first place ?**

* **Organizes your thinking:** Instead of keeping everything in your head and getting it all mixed up, write it down and structure it.
* **Makes teamwork easier:** Anyone who joins the project can quickly understand the plan and how tasks are organized.
* **Makes progress visible:** When you see what’s done and what’s coming next, you and your team will feel a real sense of achievement.

When a task moves from `New` to `Ready`, it usually means that the **Owner or Team Leader** has approved it and given the green light to work on it.


<img width="1664" height="962" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-15 150008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db433425-4221-46ad-99ac-d5d23747ea0e" />


* **Analysis Time**: This is the time when the task is in `New`, gets approved, and moves to `Ready`—meaning it’s been analyzed and accepted for implementation.

* **Cycle Time**: This is the amount of time the task takes to be completed after work starts, until it becomes `Done`.

* **Lead Time**: This is the total time from start to finish—from the moment the task is created until it’s fully completed.


### GitHub Teams Enterprise Structure

When a large company uses GitHub, it usually has many teams and a lot of work distributed across different projects and tasks. That’s why we need something like **GitHub Teams**.

For example, if you have a **Frontend Team**, **Backend Team**, and **DevOps**, you can give each team specific **permissions**. This lets you control who can do what, such as:

* Read the code
* Write to the codebase
* Merge pull requests

<img width="1664" height="1019" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-16 103022" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40162496-0c05-4c9a-bb88-851a7dd80e20" />


### 🧩 How is the Backlog divided in large companies?

(From top management down to small teams)

The **Backlog** is simply “a list of all tasks or ideas that are supposed to be done,” whether at the company level or for a specific team.

But in large companies, it’s not that simple—because not everyone should see or work on everything. That’s why it’s **divided into levels with different permissions**.


#### 🧠 1- Top Management

Roles like **CTO** and **Heads of Product** usually have the full vision of the product or system, and they manage a very large backlog that includes:

* All major features
* Long-term business goals
* Development plans for the next quarter or even the entire year

🚧 These tasks aren’t visible to everyone, because they may be sensitive or still in the early planning stage.


#### 🧭 2- Middle Management

The **Top Management** starts passing down the relevant parts of that large backlog to executive managers or team leads, who then:

* Filter the tasks
* Turn them into clear, actionable items
* Set their priorities
* And distribute them to the teams under them

**Example:**
A Product Manager takes a major feature from top management, breaks it down into 10–15 clear tasks, and assigns them to the Frontend or Backend team.


#### 🧑‍💻 3- Agile Teams

Then, **Middle Management** starts passing the tasks down to the **Agile Teams** (developers, QA, designers), giving them the part of the backlog that relates to their work. This part is usually:

* Detailed and clear (User Stories, Tasks)
* Within their permission scope
* Time-bound with clear expectations

🧾 For example, a backend developer won’t see tasks related to UI development unless they’re involved in that part.

#### A Team That Work Without Asking 
**No need to ask : What are you doing ? What's next ? What's Stuck ?**


There’s a big difference between **“you don’t need to ask”** and **“you don’t want to ask.”**

You *don’t need to ask* when all the information is clear, and every question in your mind already has an obvious answer in front of you.

But *you don’t want to ask* means you personally refuse or avoid asking—and that can have negative consequences.

* **Board Shows Real-Time Status for Everything- No Need to Ask 🧠**

The board shows the real-time status of everything happening in the team.
So you don’t have to keep sending messages asking, *“Where is this task now?”* — the answer is right in front of you.



* **No Wasted Time Chasing Update and Meetings** 🕒

If everything is clear on the board, you don’t need to waste time in meetings asking, *“What’s new?”* or send five messages to follow up on a task.
You can use that time for real work instead.


* **We Will Have Clarity , Alignment , and Speed** 🧭

When the picture is clear and everyone agrees on who’s doing what, execution speed increases.
The board isn’t just an organization tool—it’s a strategic tool.

**It Becomes the Single Source Of Truth for Everything 📌**

The board is the single source of truth.
If there’s a disagreement about something, it’s not “someone said”  it’s “the board says”


**Without Clear Communication , Even the Best Board Fails** 📉

If there’s no clear communication, even the best board in the world won’t help.
Anyone who writes tasks or comments in a vague way will end up ruining the whole workflow.


* **Poor Titles or Comments Create Confusion Instead of Clarity ❌**

An unclear title or a generic comment can easily lead to misunderstandings.
Instead of helping, it ends up creating confusion.

* **Lack of Agreed Standards Wastes Time and Energy 🔄**

If there are no clear rules for writing or breaking down tasks, we’ll waste time trying to understand what everyone meant.
Having a “standard” helps all of us work in the same way.


* **Misunderstandings Slow Delivery and Cause Frustration 🐢**

Misunderstandings don’t just slow work down—they create frustration and conflicts.
And they usually start with poor communication or a poorly organized board.


* **A Tool Can't Fix a Weak Culture – Habits Matter More 🧰**

Even the best tool in the world won’t fix team problems if the habits are wrong.
If people don’t stick to the board or don’t write in an organized way, the tool won’t help you at all.



*  **Clear, Professional Communication Is Not Optional – It’s Critical 📣**

Professional communication isn’t a luxury—it’s a foundation of work.
Your words need to be clear, respectful, and direct.


* **Strong Culture Is the Engine Behind a Strong Kanban Board 🚀**

A strong team culture is what drives the board and makes it truly useful.
Without commitment, all of this is just ink on paper.


* **The Board Should Feel Like a Conversation, Not a Puzzle 💬**

The board should be easy to follow, like reading a well-organized chat.
Not a puzzle you have to decode to understand.


- **Before Managing the Board , We Must Manage How We Communicate 📢**


Before you say, “I want to organize the board,” ask yourself:
Do we know how to communicate properly? Do we describe our work clearly?

Because the board is a reflection of how we communicate.

---

#### Success Convention , Standards & Culture ✅

- **Definition of Ready When an item can move to "Ready"** 

Before moving an item from **New → Ready**, I need to have a checklist and a well-defined **Definition of Ready**.
I must set clear conditions that an item has to meet before it’s allowed to move—and the same applies to all stages like **Review** and **Done**.

- **Blocked Items When and how to mark an item "Blocked"**

When I block any item, I have to share why it was blocked and what the standards are for accepting or rejecting it.

* **In Progress — Only move to “In Progress” if you’re actively working on it**

You should move an item to **In Progress** only when you’ve actually started working on it. That way, you’re following one of the most important principles of the board: **real-time tracking**.

- **Titles must be clear and descriptive no vague names** 

So when you write the name of an item, try to make it clear and understandable—not a code or cryptic words that only you can understand.

- **Comments must explain the context if needed , no guessing** 

Try to write a comment under each item explaining the idea and what you really mean.
Don’t leave me staring at unclear words for two hours, wondering, *“Does he mean this… or that?”* — while the sound of crickets starts playing in my head. 🦗

- **Communication should save time , not create more questions** 

When you write anything or make an update, make sure I understand it the first time.
Don’t answer one question in a way that opens the door to ten more questions because of how unclear your reply is.

This usually happens because of poor communication or weak soft skills.



#### Excellence in High Standards & Flexible Speed 

When we set the standards that the team will follow, there’s a key question that must be asked:
**Should we base the standards on the weakest person on the team, or on the strongest one?**

**Simply put, the standards should be set at the level of the strongest person on the team.**


**Example 🧠**

When two people join a gym—one who has been training for three years and another who’s entering for the first time—it’s natural that the beginner can only lift about 5 kg.

So it wouldn’t make sense to tell the experienced one, who can lift much more, “Lift only 20 kg, that’s our maximum.”
By doing that, you’re wasting the abilities of someone with experience and knowledge, and you’re also stopping them from growing. At the same time, you’re giving the weaker person the feeling that this low target is the ultimate limit.

What’s logical is to go to the person who’s been training for three years and tell him: “Give me your best—and help this guy become strong too.”
But the key point is not to set impossible timelines. Otherwise, you’ll lose everyone.

**The secret is to keep the pace balanced according to the weakest member’s ability.**
That’s not a contradiction—on the contrary, it’s the formula for success for any team that wants to grow.

---

**Another example to make it clearer 🧠**

Imagine you have a team working on a big project in Python.
One person is very skilled: writes clean code, uses decorators and generators, and even writes tests.
In the same team, there’s a beginner who can write simple functions and may get confused with scope and indentation.

**Should we define the project’s coding standards based on the beginner’s level?**
Of course not—because that would limit the stronger members and prevent the team from improving.

But at the same time, **we won’t set a deadline that forces the beginner to deliver a feature using advanced concepts he hasn’t learned yet.**


**The solution?**

* Maintain **high standards** in the code: use linters, code reviews, and best practices.
* Provide enough time and an internal learning system to help weaker members reach that level—without burning them out with pressure.

**This balance achieves three things ✅**

* Strong performers don’t get bored or feel the work is below their level.
* Learners don’t get discouraged or feel like a burden.
* The whole team moves forward in the same direction, but at a pace that suits each individual.

When you’re appointed as a manager in a company, the first thing you shouldn’t do is gather everyone and say,
“Come on, if I don’t like you, you’re out,” or “You didn’t hit the target, I’m deducting two days from your salary.”
That makes you a bad manager.

If you see someone struggling, put them on a development plan for a specific period and give them a real chance to grow and stay on the team.


***Continuous Improvement it's not Optional , it's the Only Way to Survive***

### Data Driven Decisions


#### Lead to Better ✅

When we’re making decisions—especially work-related ones—it has nothing to do with personal feelings or favoritism.
Come and tell me: *Why are you taking this decision?* What data do you have that makes you say that?

**Ex :**

If God blesses you and you become one of those three-letter roles (CEO, CTO, WC, etc.), and your system needs a new feature, will you use your authority to force the team to build it?

Of course not. First, you need to look at a few things, then decide:

* How much will this feature consume from the company’s resources (engineers, money, time)?
* How many people actually *need* this feature? Focus on the difference between *need* and *want* —
  **what you want vs. what you need**.
* Will the profit cover the costs spent on it?

So, when you’re thinking about making a decision—whether it’s to solve a problem or improve the business—you look at your KPIs first, then decide.

**KPI = Key Performance Indicator**

***Everything Must Be Recorded Correctly & Accurately to Fuel Data Decision***

**See how big this topic is, my man? 😎**

---


#### The Board Drives Problem Solving & Success

- **if "New" is empty ?**

If there are no tasks in **“New,”** then there’s no plan and no clear direction—so chaos becomes the leader.

Management is basically about having limited resources and a lot of work, and figuring out how to get everything done in the best way and in the shortest time possible.

- **if "Ready" is empty ?**

If **“Ready”** is empty, it means we’re not analyzing the work before starting it—there’s no preparation.

**Guess work is not a strategy**

- **if "in progress" is empty ?**

In a classy and simple way: you’re saying things, but you’re not actually doing them 😅

- **if "Review" , "Done" is empty?**

It means you’re working, but you don’t know how to finish what you started.
You don’t have a clear plan in your head, don’t really know what’s required from you, or how to implement it.

### The Critical Role of Quality Data in DDD

**What does *"data"* mean in this context and how does is created ?**

***DDD = Data Driven Decision*** 

We agreed that data is the center of everything and that decisions are based on it, right?

So what if that data is collected the wrong way, arrives late, or is recorded in different formats?

The result: confused decisions, unclear vision, and flawed analysis.

#### Examples of “dirty data” that can seriously damage DDD ✋

* 🔸 *Mohamed marked the status as “Done,” while Ahmed marked the same status as “Completed.”*
  Result? They’re counted as two different statuses.

* 🔸 *A task was actually completed on Day 1, but recorded on Day 4.*
  Result? The data shows the team was late, even though that’s not true.

* 🔸 *The same entry was recorded twice with the same information—once manually and once automatically.*
  Result? Duplicate data that distorts the analysis.

**DDD = Content + Context + Timing + Consistency**

* **Clear content:** What exactly did you record?
* **Clear context:** Where was it recorded, and why?
* **Accurate timing:** When did it happen?
* **Consistent format:** Is everyone using the same rules when recording data?

***Garbage in = Garbage out***

No matter how strong the analysis is, if the data is wrong or flawed, the result will be wrong.
